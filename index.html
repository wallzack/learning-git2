      <h1>Song: Walk</h1>
      <h2>Pantera</h2>
      <p>
        Can't you see I'm easily bothered by persistence<br>
        One step from lashing out at you<br>
        You want in, to get under my skin and call yourself a friend<br>
        I've got more friends like you, what do I do?<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Is there no standard anymore?<br>
        What it takes, who I am, where I've been belong<br>
        You can't be something you're not<br>
        Be yourself, by yourself, stay away from me<br>
        A lesson learned in life<br>
        Known from the dawn of time<br>
      </p>
      <p class="chorus">
        Respect, walk, what did you say?<br>
        Respect, walk<br>
        Are you talkin' to me? Are you talkin' to me?<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Run your mouth when I'm not around, it's easy to achieve<br>
        You cry to weak friends that sympathize<br>
        Can you hear the violins playing your song?<br>
        Those same friends tell me your every word<br>
      </p>
